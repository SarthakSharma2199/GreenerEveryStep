                        is the
                        only thing that ever has."</h2>

                    The environment is where we all meet, where all have a mutual interest, it is the one thing all
                    of us share. Our planet's alarm has been ringing for quite a while and it is high time to take
                    action. The only way forward to help our planet is by getting everybody involved. Easier said
                    than done, environment protection requires unified individual and government support, however,
                    the best way to kickstart progress is by motivating people to take steps within their capacity.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    We at "Greener Every Step" believe that the best way to connect us humans is through shared stories.
                    The little steps that people incorporate in their daily lives can go a long way. By sharing their
                    personal stories it can inspire other people and act as a catalyst. Simple ideas like ways to reduce
                    plastic and energy usage can have tremendous results if they are used by large portion of the
                    population and it does not require any special government support.

            
                <br><br>

                    We want to share these inspiring stories and creative ideas to make people interested in this cause
                    because plans to protect air, water, wilderness and wildlife are in fact plans to protect humanity
                    itself.
                    <br><br>

                    So even if we start small, let our every step be guided in being “Greener Every Step”.
