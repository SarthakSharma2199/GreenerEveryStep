                    To this day this incredible initiative is called “world’s largest beach clean-up project”.
                    Environmentalist
                    Afroz Shaz started picking up the trash from the beach back in 2015, with more and more people
                    joining him,
                    volunteers managed to pick up 5,3 million kilograms of trash. Versova beach in Mumbai was polluted
                    mainly
                    because
                    of the direction of the wind. Since the territory itself was not a popular tourist attraction, there
                    was no
                    action
                    taken to take care of the beach. Now, with the help of 1,000 volunteers, the beach is open for the
                    public to
                    enjoy.
                    There are over 8 billion tons of plastic thrown into our ocean every year. If you wish to reduce
                    your plastic
                    waste try avoiding single-use cutlery, take away coffee cups, use your own grocery bag instead of
                    plastic one,
                    and buy as many plastic-free products as you can.

                    Anil Malhotra and his wife Pamela Gale Malhotra own India's only private wildlife sanctuary, but
                    it's taken
                    decades of replanting and protecting forests and wildlife to get it to where it is today. Pamela
                    says, "When
                    we first came here, most of the lands that were sold to us, were abandoned lands. Abandoned rice
                    fields, coffee,
                    and cardamom fields as well. A lot of deforestation had taken place. And that took a lot, a lot of
                    care and
                    energy and time and years to bring it back."
                    From the time they bought it in 1991, the place looks unrecognisable now, in the best way possible.
                    It's
                    located in Kodagu district, covers 300 acres and is home to more than 200 globally endangered
                    species of
                    plants and animals, including Asian elephants and Bengal tigers.

        <div class="container-fluid" id="mainstory3">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-4">

                    The dry and infertile land of Ladakh makes life pretty hard there, and average rainfall is also
                    pitifully
                    low. People are dependent on glaciers for water for farming, so Chewang Norphel started making
                    artificial
                    glaciers based on an idea that came to him when he saw water dripping from a tap which was kept open
                    so as
                    to avoid the water from freezing in winter and bursting. The water gradually froze into the shape of
                    an ice
                    sheet as it came in touch with the ground and made a pool. He used this as a foundation for a
                    similar
                    technique using canals and helped provide water to villagers. He's called Ice Man, which is just
                    plain cool
                    if you ask us.
