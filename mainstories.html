        Story 1
        To this day this incredible initiative is called “world’s largest beach clean-up project”. Environmentalist 
        Afroz Shaz started picking up the trash from the beach back in 2015, with more and more people joining him, 
        volunteers managed to pick up 5,3 million kilograms of trash. Versova beach in Mumbai was polluted mainly because 
        of the direction of the wind. Since the territory itself was not a popular tourist attraction, there was no action 
        taken to take care of the beach. Now, with the help of 1,000 volunteers, the beach is open for the public to enjoy. 
        There are over 8 billion tons of plastic thrown into our ocean every year. If you wish to reduce your plastic 
        waste try avoiding single-use cutlery, take away coffee cups, use your own grocery bag instead of plastic one, 
        and buy as many plastic-free products as you can.

        Story 2
        Anil Malhotra and his wife Pamela Gale Malhotra own India's only private wildlife sanctuary, but it's taken 
        decades of replanting and protecting forests and wildlife to get it to where it is today. Pamela says, "When 
        we first came here, most of the lands that were sold to us, were abandoned lands. Abandoned rice fields, coffee,
         and cardamom fields as well. A lot of deforestation had taken place. And that took a lot, a lot of care and 
         energy and time and years to bring it back."
         From the time they bought it in 1991, the place looks unrecognisable now, in the best way possible. It's 
         located in Kodagu district, covers 300 acres and is home to more than 200 globally endangered species of 
         plants and animals, including Asian elephants and Bengal tigers.

        Story 3
        The dry and infertile land of Ladakh makes life pretty hard there, and average rainfall is also pitifully 
        low. People are dependent on glaciers for water for farming, so Chewang Norphel started making artificial 
        glaciers based on an idea that came to him when he saw water dripping from a tap which was kept open so as 
        to avoid the water from freezing in winter and bursting. The water gradually froze into the shape of an ice 
        sheet as it came in touch with the ground and made a pool. He used this as a foundation for a similar 
        technique using canals and helped provide water to villagers. He's called Ice Man, which is just plain cool 
        if you ask me.
